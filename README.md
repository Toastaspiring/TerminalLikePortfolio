# Terminal Like Portfolio  
This **Portfolio** is designed like a UNIX terminal as a way to showcase my skills with web related languages

## How it works

As weird as a Terminal on website can be, I will try to explain how made my Portfolio with detail.

### The Terminal
It's made out of 3 part :
 - initial prompt which contain ```"helpCmdList"``` 
 - the inputbox with `oninput` and `onkeydown` events 
 - the suggestion < div > which show suggestions based on input
 
 When in the terminal, each time the user press a key, it triggers a javascript function called `handleKeyDown(event)` where `event` is the key pressed
```javascript
function  handleKeyDown(n) {
	var  e,
		s  =  document.getElementById("suggestions"),
		i  =  s.getElementsByTagName("div");
	"ArrowUp"  ===  n.key
		? (n.preventDefault(),
			0  <  currentSuggestionIndex  &&  currentSuggestionIndex--)
		:  "ArrowDown"  ===  n.key
		? (n.preventDefault(),
			currentSuggestionIndex  <  i.length  -  1  &&  currentSuggestionIndex++)
		:  "Enter"  ===  n.key  &&
			((n  =  document.getElementById("cmd")),
			(e  =  i[currentSuggestionIndex]) && (n.value  =  e.textContent),
			(s.innerHTML  =  ""),
			n.classList.remove("command-entered"));
	for (let  n  =  0; n  <  i.length; n++) {
		var  l  =  i[n];
		n  ===  currentSuggestionIndex
		?  l.classList.add("selected")
		:  l.classList.remove("selected");
	}
}
```
Keyboard Event Handling:
   - The code checks the value of `n.key`, which represents the key that was pressed during the keyboard event.
   - If `n.key` is "ArrowUp":
     - Prevents the default behavior of the keyboard event (e.g., preventing the cursor from moving).
     - Decrements the value of `currentSuggestionIndex` by 1 if it's greater than 0.
   - If `n.key` is "ArrowDown":
     - Prevents the default behavior of the keyboard event.
     - Increments the value of `currentSuggestionIndex` by 1 if it's less than the total number of suggestions minus 1 (`i.length - 1`).
   - If `n.key` is "Enter":
     - Gets a reference to an HTML element with the ID "cmd" and assigns it to the variable `n`.
     - Retrieves the suggestion element at the current index (`currentSuggestionIndex`) and assigns it to the variable `e`.
     - Sets the value of the "cmd" input field (`n.value`) to the text content of the selected suggestion (`e.textContent`).
     - Clears the content of the "suggestions" element (`s.innerHTML = ""`).
     - Removes the "command-entered" class from the "cmd" element (`n.classList.remove("command-entered")` to indicate input matche a command).

Loop through Suggestions:
   - The code then enters a loop that iterates through all the suggestion elements stored in the `i` collection.
   - For each suggestion element `l`:
     - If the index `n` is equal to `currentSuggestionIndex`, it adds the "selected" class to the suggestion element to highlight it.
     - Otherwise, it removes the "selected" class from the suggestion element to deselect it.
 
 ### The Rest is basically `style` I picked up here and there...

I hope you enjoyed this little explanation since we were only interested in the terminal, you can review the code on your computer since I pull request are activated.
